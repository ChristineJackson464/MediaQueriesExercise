/* START BELOW THIS LINE */


G. Complete the following in your CSS file below the “START BELOW THIS LINE” comment in the above CSS (Do not alter the html in any way)...

1. Change the background color on the body element to navy blue when the viewport width is less than 800px

2. Change the background color on the body element to orange when the viewport width is less than 600px

3. Give the “One” h1 a 10px dashed gray border & the “Three” h1 a 10px dotted gray border when viewport width is greater than 600px AND the viewport height is less than 400px

4. Give the “Two” h1 a 10px solid gray top border when viewport width is greater than 900px OR the viewport height is greater than 500px

5. When the viewport is in landscape mode (Width is greater than height) have the three h1 elements display in a row (HINT: Flexbox)

6. When the viewport is in portrait mode (Height greater than width) have the three h1 elements display in a column in the center of the screen


BONUS

BONUS-1. Have all the text display in uppercase and change the color to green ONLY when the user attempts to print the page.

BONUS-2. Have the “Two” h1 text color match the background color set to the body element whenever it changes from white to another color. 
If completed correctly the “Two” h1 will seem invisible when the background color set to the body is NOT white (HINT: Navy & Orange).


BONUS-3. Make all the text on the webpage Italicized when the viewport width is a length from 750px to 775px AND the viewport height is a length from 550px to 575px
